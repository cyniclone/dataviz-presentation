    # Today - Design, Data and Graphics

     * Data Viz - Tools and Techniques
     * D3.js - Data Driven Documents
     * P5.js - Interactive Graphics

    <!-- "I want to keep this less rigid, and more open to discussion and interaction" -->

    # Why Data Viz?
     * Between the beginning of time and 2003, humanity generated roughly five exabytes
    (10<sup>18</sup> bytes) of data.
     * Now, we produce the same amount *every two days*.
     * For reference, this is about 200,000 years of DVD-quality video.

    <!-- Start by introducing CodePen and showing the interface
       Mention that CodePen is good because:
      *  It takes away the hassle of setting up a project
      *  It also gives us more liberty to make mistakes
      *  It allows reference line numbers
